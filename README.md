GOAC Neptune WIP

# Neptune 32X/MD2

The Sega Neptune was an unreleased console that would have been a stand-alone 32X.
This project provides a PCB that combines the 32X and Mega Drive/Genesis 2 that fits
in an original Mega Drive/Genesis 2 case or the reimagined Neptune case designed by
DVIZIX.

**NOTE**: In order to use these PCBs successfully you will need to be proficient in:

* Soldering-fine pitched surface mount components.
* In most cases, desoldering said components to obtain these from a donor board.
* Troubleshooting any issues that may arise.

Development and testing of these PCBs has shown that successfully assembling a
working board is challenging even for skilled, experienced builders. Please read the
build notes below carefully before starting. If you are in any doubt, it is highly
recommended to enlist the help of someone with a known track record.

The authors are not obliged to provide support, nor shall they be held responsible
for botched attempts at using these boards. Should you however find a legitimate flaw
in the board's design or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to
submit an issue.


## Errata

When using anything other than the latest release, check against this table if there
are any outstanding fixes that should be applied to your particular board revision.

## Features and Limitations

* Fits original Mega Drive 2 (PAL), Genesis 2 or DVIZIX Neptune cases. Separate
  power/reset switch locations are provided for each (see the `stl` directory for
  files with which to 3D print spacers for the buttons if using the DVIZIX case).
* NOT compatible with the Japanese Mega Drive 2 case due to this using a sliding
  power switch with a different footprint to that of the push button style.
* Modern power circuit by Zaxour (requires 9V DC PSU rated for at least 1A).
* Integrated switchless region mod using PIC16F630 or compatible programmed with
  the `switchless_xxxx.hex` files in this repo ([source here][Switchless]). Use
  the file that matches your LED's pinout.
* Integrated "Triple Bypass" mod for improved RGB and audio.
* Provisional support for Sega Master System games via integrated mod by DogP.\*
* Compatible with the original Sega CD/Mega CD.\*\*
* Not compatible with flash cart-based Sega CD/Mega CD implementations such as
  the Mega EverDrive Pro. The Mega SD does how ever work when used in combination
  with the MSDEXP expansion port adapter (thanks to Bob from [RetroRGB](https://www.retrorgb.com/)
  for [testing this live][RetroRGBCDVideo]).
* As the 32X hardware is integrated into the design, there is NO way to disable this.
* No mono audio output.
* No Dual Frequency Oscillator (DSO) is built in but, should you opt to install
  one that fits in the original oscillator footprint, a pad for the PAL/NTSC
  switching signal is provided close by.

\* Master System compatibility is not extensively tested. Original cartridges have
been shown to work when using simple pass-through adapters. Using Mega Drive flash
carts to run Master System games may or may not work. Some such cartridges check for
the presence of a 32X and, if detected, will refuse to boot in Master System mode,
as this would usually cause a hardware conflict. In some cases this check can be
disabled in the flash cart's menu. While we believe that this is safe, you do so at
your own risk.

\*\* The model 2 Sega CD/Mega CD uses the +9V pin on the expansion connector to power
itself on along with the attached console. This board does not however provide 9V
to this pin. Testing has shown that the CD hardware will also power on with only 5V
on this pin. We're not aware of any add-ons that require 9V on the expansion connector,
so what would usually be +9V is connected to +5V by a trace between the pads near
B26 and B28. If you do however really need it, there is another +9V pad near the
power jack. This is however not switched along with the console and will remain
powered as long as there is power to the jack. You could rig up something with
a transistor or MOSFET to make 9V switch on along with the console. Of course, making
any such modification will require the trace between +5V and +9V be cut.


## PCB Production

Minimum track widths, clearances and via sizes are within the standard
offering of modern PCB fabricators. Gerber files are generated with the relevant
options for [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) (included in the "Assets" section of
the individual [releases][Releases]). Placeholders for the order number are
provided so remember to select the "Specify location" option for this when ordering.
If using another service you may wish to remove or replace this placeholder.
If using PCBWay, please consider using this [shared project][PCBWayProject] for
which a percentage of the order amount is credited to the author. (However, if you
really want to contribute, a less expensive PCB service and a donation via
[Ko-fi][Ko-fi] works out better for all involved!)

The design is verified to work as a 4-layer PCB with 1 oz outer and 1/2 oz inner
layers. The intended layer order is Front, In1, In2, Back. A leaded HASL finish is
adequate and ensures compatibility with the original solder that will inevitably be
left behind on salvaged parts. If you plan to use a Mega CD/Sega CD or anything that
uses the edge connector you might want to opt for an ENIG or other gold finish for
this. Chamfering of the expansion edge connector is recommended.

For independent testing of the Mega Drive side, you might like to try Chrissy's
experimental bypass boards for IC504 and IC505 in the ``helpers`` directory (more
info below in the build notes).


## Bill of Materials

For a complete BOM, consult the KiCad project itself. For assembly you may wish
to use the generated Interactive BOM but this is not as detailed (use the
`ibom.html` file in the "Assets" section of [your board's release][Releases]).

Parts are numbered according to the following scheme:

| Number  | Description                                        |
|:-------:|:---------------------------------------------------|
| < 500   | Original to Mega Drive/Genesis 2                   |
| 500-599 | Original to 32X (subtract 500 for original number) |
| >= 600  | Additional/replacement parts                       |

It is assumed that most parts will be obtained from donor Mega Drive/Genesis and
32X units. The project was initially based on a VA1 PAL Mega Drive 2 and VA1 PAL
32X. [Other Mega Drive/Genesis revisions][Revisions] may be usable if these also
use a 315-5660 or [compatible ASIC][ASICs]. Be aware that some ASICs (e.g. the
315-5660-10 variant found on some Japanese revisions) are known not to support 50
Hz operation which will limit the usefullness of the integrated switchless region
mod. All 32X revisions should be usable but this has not yet been confirmed. Note
the differences in parts between MD and 32X revisions/regions as documented in the
schematics. It is probably not feasible to list the differences between all possible
revisions but should you work out a solution for a particular donor board, please
let us know so we can include it in this documentation.

Parts marked "\*" have different values based on region or revision, or may not be
present on some revisions, so refer to the schematic and your donor hardware.
Parts marked "PAL" on the board are supposedly only used on PAL Mega Drives. Parts
marked "VA0" and "VA1" are for those revisions of 32X only. However, should your
donor hardware have any of these parts it would seem wise to transfer them to the
new board regardless of the original region/revision. When in doubt just remember
that, when it come to original parts, in essence it is about moving the donors'
parts to the new board. If it's on the donor, use it; if it's not, then it was never
required in the first place.

For 32X main boards with the SCA chip, pay particular attention to `D699`. If your
donor 32X has a THT diode for `/VRES` on the main board you will need to install this
or an SMD equivalent at this location. The footprint is however bridged, as on other
revisions there is no diode and this is simply a direct connection. If installing the
diode you will therefore need to cut the trace between the pads. The accompanying
capacitor may be installed at location `C695`.

All SMD passives on the board have 0805 or larger footprints for easier soldering.
Inductor footprints are 1210 but you can of course use narrower such as 1206.
If reusing MD2 passives, these should therefore fit well. Many 32X passives are
smaller but should still fit. If you plan to reuse them, do note that particularly
the smaller capacitors are prone to losing their metal end caps and, being so small,
this is not always immediately apparent. If you see solder balling up instead of
flowing nicely, this may well be the problem.

Tolerances of original capacitors are unknown but 20% for electrolytic and 5% for
SMD types is a good rule of thumb. If lower is available, even better. Any critical
tolerances will be specified on the schematic/BOM. Capacitor voltages are stated
where known. 0805 capacitors generally have a voltage rating of 50V or more, which
is more than sufficient.


## Build Notes

### General

* Before disassembling the donor consoles, test these thoroughly using the "Mars
  Checker" diagnostic ROM. Please note that running this from some flash carts
  (particular EverDrive models or Mega SD) may yield unreliable results. Even on
  known-good original hardware, you may be presented with a red screen when booting
  or test runs may/may not succeed seemingly at random. For this reason, it's
  recommended to run the tests several times. If you are unable to boot the
  diagnostics using your particular flash cart, consider a simpler single-image
  (i.e. no menu) one or something EPROM-based.

* Macho Nacho Productions has an [informative video][MachoNachoVideo] on the build
  process you may like to check out to get a general idea of what's required.

* The ICs on at least one side of the 32X main board (the "cartridge" part) are glued
  on making removal tricky. The glue can be softened using isopropyl alcohol, so you
  may want to give the board soak in this before starting to avoid having to use too
  much heat. Low-melt solder (e.g. ChipQuik) is very much recommended. Avoid extended
  use of hot air to avoid damaging these potentially fragile chips.

* It may sound obvious, but pay close attention to orientation when fitting ICs. The
  32X SDRAM (IC503) and some of the QFP packages have particularly subtle markings.
  It helps to mark (e.g. with tape or a groove in the package casing) pin one before
  removing the ICs from the donor boards. The legend silkscreen on the board *should*
  match that on the IC but this may not always be a reliable indicator of orientation.

* Similarly, there are two different sizes of oscillator package and the footprint has
  holes to mount either size. If using the smaller DIP-8 size, observe the correct
  location of pin 1 in the middle of the footprint and install the oscillator towards
  `IC6` as indicated by the arrows.

* Clean all boards thoroughly with e.g. isopropyl alcohol prior to starting.
  Especially HASL boards from JLC have been known to arrive with some contaminants
  present which prevent reliable solder joints. You may even like to tin the SMD
  pads and clean up with braid/wick to ensure that solder will adhere properly.

* The Triple Bypass mod features a low pass filter that can be enabled or disabled by
  fitting `R966` or `R965` respectively. As the LPF has both advantages and
  disadvantages, the choice is left to the builder. When using the provided PCB
  assembly files, the LPF is enabled by default. Otherwise, you must fit one of these
  resistors; the enable pin may not be left floating. Enabling the LPF may improve
  Mega Drive image quality at the expense of artefacts in 32X graphics. Disabling it
  may be preferable if you are using a video scaler. YMMV, so do what works for your
  particular setup.


### Order of Operations

It is possible to break down parts the build into separate steps to allow for easier
testing and troubleshooting. The following is a suggested order of operations.

* Build the power circuit (all parts in the X800 range) and test this separately.
  It should provide a steady 5V supply even without any load.

* Add the 3.3V regulator (IC510) for the 32X SDRAM and its associated capacitors.
  Check for 3.3V on the regulator output as labeled on the board.

* You may wish to install the PIC for the switchless region mod at this point as
  it should operate independently of the rest of the system. Install also the LED,
  passives in the X700 range and a temporary ~10K pull-up on `/WRES` (pin 11).
  R702 limits current through the LED and therefore determines its brightness.
  The value is based on the original MD2 LED, so you may prefer to use a higher
  value when using a modern LED, which tend to be brighter for the same current.
  If your LED has protruding "lugs" instead of just straight pins, it's recommended
  to trim these off if possible before installation to avoid damaging the board.
  Hold down the reset button to cycle through regions as indicated on the RGB LED.
  If the LED changes constantly, check pull-up `R701` is installed. The PAL/NTSC
  and JP/ENG outputs should change as appropriate. Verify that a short press of
  the button generates a `/WRES` pulse.

* If not using the switchless mod, or to bypass it for testing/troubleshooting,
  link the indicated pins and set the desired PAL/NTSC and JP/ENG values using the
  +5V and GND pads on the `IC701` footprint. Connect the LED pin of your choice to
  +5V and a single colour LED for `LED701`.

* At this point it's time to strap in and install all the MD2 components and the
  audio and video parts shared between MD and 32X. This cannot be independently
  tested without bypassing the 32X parts that usually connect to the cartridge slot.
  To this end, you may like to use the bypass flexes for IC504 and IC505 (see the
  `helpers` directory). These boards are designed to fit in place of the 32X ICs
  and simply pass the required signals directly to the Mega Drive components. If
  using the bypass boards, you will also need to temporarily connect the /YS and
  /AS signals to the cartridge slot. /YS has a labeled test point for this near
  pin B12 on the underside of the slot. /AS can be connected by bridging pins 8
  and 12 on the footprint for `IC516`. Remove these connections before installing
  the remaining 32X hardware.

* When testing a newly-built Neptune, trying different kinds of cartridges and
  peripherals is useful for troubleshooting issues. Original Mega Drive cartridges
  are a good place to start as these should run even if the 32X hardware isn't
  fully operational. Running Master System cartridges via an adapter also hits
  different functionality in the MD VDP/ASIC, Z80, memory, etc. If no cartridges
  work, you may be able to boot to the BIOS screen of a Mega CD/Sega CD, which
  would point to issues around the cartridge slot and/or 32X bus multiplexing.
  Once the basic functionality is verified, diagnostics such as those in the
  [240p Test Suite][240p] and Mars Checker can be used to troubleshoot any
  remaining issues.

* For a fully assembled board WITHOUT any cables connected there should be around
  350 Ohms between VCC and ground. If you measure something wildly different this
  may indicate a short, an incorrectly installed IC or similar. With the video
  cable connected the resistance will drop to around 150 Ohms.
